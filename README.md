<br/>

#### **1.1 Target Audience**

* This website is aimed at anyone who either owns, or is considering buying an investment property and wants to understand the kind of returns that property may deliver.

#### **1.2 Visitor goals** 

* I want to be able to use the site to see at a glance the type of returns a property i own, or am thinking of buying, will return. 

#### **1.3 Business goals**

* No business or monetary goals, just a user friendly tool that lets users workout and breakdown their bills in a few clicks.

#### **1.4 User Stories**

* As a visitor to the company website i expect/want/need
 

#### **1.5 Design choices** 

* Project is still under construction so nothing finalized yet. 

#### **FONTS**

* The ont i have chosen for this project is [Didact Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Didact+Gothic?query=dida&sort=popularity&preview.text=This%20is%20how%20the%20font%20will%20look&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles). Didact Gothic is a sans-serif font designed to present each letter in the form most often used in elementary classrooms. This makes it suitable for literacy efforts.

![Image of how the font will look](images/readme_images/math_my_property_font.png)

#### **ICONS**

* I decided i would use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) icons for the project. Icons8 has a wide range of colorful and animated icons that are free to use. 

#### **COLOURS**

* Project is still under construction so colours finalized yet.

<br/>

#### **2.1 The Navbar**

![Image of Navbar](images/readme_images/)

* The Navbar is a standard bootstrap Navbar. It holds the company logo in the top left hand corner and menu items which are links. On mobile devices the logo and the site name will always stay visible.

#### **2.2 User Inputs** 

![Image of user inputs](images/readme_images/)

* The user only has several inputs to work with. The are:  

#### **2.3 Action Buttons**

![Image of action buttons](images/readme_images/)

* There are 2 button types for the user to interact with. The main one will trigger the calculated results once the user has added all of the information into the input fields. The second type of button is the reset button. Users have the ability to reset specific sections on the inputs, or to reset the entire form as a whole. 

* Note: The user doesn't have to reset the entire calculator if they wish to change something after a breakdown has been given. If they wish to change something they can just adjust one single field and press the work it out button and the calculation will run again. 

#### **2.4 Financial Breakdown**

![Image of Financial Breakdown](images/readme_images/)

* The results section will show the user at a glance the detailed returns the property will deliver. These input fields have been disabled so users are unable to alter or adjust the information that gets displayed after the calculation has been displayed.   

#### **2.5 Footer**

![Image of footer](assets/images/footer.png)

* The footer contains the basic information on the site and the copyright.

#### **2.6 Features Left To Implement**

* As this projects is still under development i will be adding new features as i build it. 

* I may also add a dark mode to the project. I am yet to finalize the design aspect of the project so a dark mode will depend on the primary design i decide to go with.
