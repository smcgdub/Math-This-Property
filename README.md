# **Math This Property - Real Estate Calculator**

## **Introduction**

This real estate app allows landlords, investors, and prospective buyers to workout the financial returns a property will deliver for them. Users can see gross and net returns as well as ROI (Return On Investment) as well as factor in all of the deductions. The project will start out basic and i will add more features and expand it as time goes by. I have added a request a feature function on the page to allow for user guided feedback.

<summary><strong>1.User Experience (UX)</strong></summary>
<br/>

#### **1.1 Target Audience**

* This website is aimed at anyone who either owns, or is considering buying an investment property and wants to understand the kind of financial returns that property may deliver.

#### **1.2 Visitor goals** 

* I want to be able to use the site to enter some details and then see at a glance the type of financial returns a property i own, or am thinking of buying, will return. 

#### **1.3 Business goals**

* As the site owner there are no business or monetary goals, this is just a free user friendly tool that lets users workout the returns a property will produce for them.

#### **1.4 User Stories**

* As a visitor to the company website i expect/want/need
 

#### **1.5 Design choices** 

* Below are the design choices i chose for the site. 

#### **FONTS**

* The font i have chosen for this project is [Didact Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Didact+Gothic?query=dida&sort=popularity&preview.text=This%20is%20how%20the%20font%20will%20look&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles). Didact Gothic is a sans-serif font designed to present each letter in the form most often used in elementary classrooms. This makes it suitable for literacy efforts.

![Image of how the font will look](images/readme_images/math_my_property_font.png)

#### **ICONS**

* I decided i would use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) icons for the project. Icons8 has a wide range of colorful and animated icons that are free to use. 

* I also used a small number of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons on the site

#### **COLOURS**

* Below you will see the colour palette i used for the project.

![Image of the colour pallet used for the project](images/readme_images/math_this_property_colour_palette.png)

* Originally when i was designing the site logo i came across this design on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![Image of the original logo](images/readme_images/original_logo_design.png)

* I did not like the red or the name so I adjusted the colour scheme and the name and ended up with the final logo below:

![Image of the final logo](images/readme_images/math_this_property_logo_readme.png)

#### **1.6 Wire Frames** 

* The wireframes for the project can be seen below. There is a wireframe for desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### **DESKTOP**

#### **TABLET**

<summary><strong>2. Features</strong></summary>
<br/>

#### **2.1 The Navbar**

* The Navbar is a standard bootstrap Navbar. It holds the company logo in the top left hand corner and menu items which are links. On mobile devices the logo and the site name will always stay visible. On mobile devices the Navbar will collapse to a standard hamburger navbar.

#### **DESKTOP**
![Image of Navbar Desktop](images/readme_images/navbar_desktop.png)

#### **MOBILE**
![Image of Navbar Mobile Closed](images/readme_images/navbar_mobile_closed.png)

#### **MOBILE**
![Image of Navbar Mobile Open](images/readme_images/navbar_mobile_open.png)

#### **2.2 User Inputs** 

![Image of user inputs](images/readme_images/user_input_field.png)

* The user has several input fields to work with. The user input fields are coloured light yellow (#ffffe0 HEX) to differentiate them from the output fields which are disabled so the user can not adjust them.  

#### **2.3 Action Buttons**

![Image of action buttons](images/readme_images/action_buttons_2.png)
![Image of action buttons](images/readme_images/action_buttons_1.png)
![Image of action buttons](images/readme_images/action_buttons_3.png)

* There are 2 button types for the user to interact with. They are:

1. Calculate monthly costs<br>
2. Calculate annual costs<br>
3. Calculate all costs<br>

* When the user presses one of these buttons the relevant calculations will be carried out and be displayed to the user. 

* The 2nd type of button the user can interact with is the reset buttons. And they are:

1. Reset monthly costs
2. Reset annual costs
3. Reset all costs

* When the user presses one of these buttons the relevant fields will be reset to zero and displayed ot the user. 

* Note: The user doesn't have to reset the entire calculator if they wish to change something after a breakdown has been given. If they wish to change something they can just adjust one single field and press the work it out button and the calculation will run again. 

#### **2.4 Financial Breakdown**

![Image of the results fields](images/readme_images/the_results_fields.png)

* The results section will show the user at a glance the detailed returns the property will deliver. These input fields have been disabled so users are unable to alter or adjust the information that gets displayed after the calculation has been displayed.   

#### **2.5 Footer**

![Image of footer](images/readme_images/footer.png)

* The footer contains the basic information on the site and the copyright.

#### **2.6 Features Left To Implement**

* As this projects is still under development i will be adding new features as i go
* I have added a request a feature message box so users can request features
* I am aiming to look at possibly adding a dark mode
